# Overveiw
Multiple sequence alignment is one of the most important algorithms in biological information. Currently, there are many excellent tools designed for multiple sequence alignment. However, we might want a simple way to implement it in our project. This project is based on the spoa algorithm (https://github.com/rvaser/spoa.git) and provides several simple files for our convenience. Among them, ‘msaLWTest.cpp’ gives use cases.

# Installation
We provide a use case, users can simply compile it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/junhaiqi/msaLW.git && cd masLW
make
```
